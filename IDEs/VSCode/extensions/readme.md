# # Importing and exporting extensions

- See the Makefile in parent directory for commands.
- If using WSL, it is recommended to perform these tasks on Windows, and then sync all extensions. Otherwise, you may miss some extensions when exporting (since not all of them are enabled in WSL by default), and the extensions may not be available outside of WSL if importing just in WSL.
