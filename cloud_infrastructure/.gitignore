# Based on: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/c0ca84849cf0fca8ba50bc488885148caff59994/Terraform.gitignore

# Custom rules
# =============

# To exclude a tfvars file (e.g., if repo is public), explicitly name it `untracked.tfvars`
untracked.*.tfvars

# Exclude specific env vars, except for template file
*.env
!*.env.template


# Standard TF conventions
# ========================

# Local .terraform directories and files
# Note: Due to trailing `/`, this does NOT ignore lock file, which should be tracked: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/dependency-lock
**/.terraform/

# .tfstate files
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*

# Crash log files
crash.log
crash.*.log

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
# !example_override.tf

# Include tfplan files to ignore the plan output of command: terraform plan -out=tfplan
# example: *tfplan*

# Ignore CLI configuration files
.terraformrc
terraform.rc
